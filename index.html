        <ul>
        <li>Hi! My name is Anjali and I am a second year undergraduate student at University of California, Berkeley. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics. I am interested in natural language processing, more specifically applications involving low resource languages. In linguistics, I am mostly focused on Dravidian languages (because who doesn't love to study themselves) and interested in Proto-Dravidian. I also love teaching and basically any time I'm not studying or doing research is spent doing things related to that.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>../Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, Linguistics <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">[University of California, Berkeley]</a> </strong></li> 
                <li><em>Awards:</em> Dean's List.</li>

                <li><strong>Association of Women Engineers <a href="https://awe.berkeley.edu">[AWE]</a></strong> I'm just a general member, but it's loads of fun and great to meet other girls who are pursuing CS!</li>
                <li><strong>Habitat for Humanity <a href="https://www.calhabitat.org">[CalHabitat]</a></strong> Super fun and super rewarding, I helped build playhouses for children of families who were given homes through habitat for humanity.</li>

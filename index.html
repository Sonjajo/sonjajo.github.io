        <div>I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science at UC Berkeley with a minor in Creative Writing. 
            I spent this past summer doing High Performance Computing Research under <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~karavan/">Dr. Karen Karavanic</a> at Portland State University.
            Before that, I won an award from <a href="https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/">Computing Research Association–Women</a> to do a Cybersecurity internship with Dr. Karavanic.
            During the school year, I'm a software developer at <a href="https://calblueprint.org">Blueprint</a> and when I step away from my computer, I'm usually out rock climbing in Yosemite
                or <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/38547225">cycling</a> the Bay Area.
            I’m presently on the lookout for SWE internships and Computing Research opportunities. 
            My email and resume are above, please don't hesitate to reach out!

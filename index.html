        Hello! I'm a rising junior at UC Berkeley majoring in computer science, 
        with interests in software engineering, cybersecurity, and the environment. 
        I’m currently combining those interests with an internship at Lawrence Livermore National 
        Lab’s <a href="https://cyber-internship.llnl.gov/">Cybersecurity Summer Institute</a> working on power grid and network resilience.
        <br/> 
        <br/> 
        I’m also passionate about education, in particular, supporting and advocating for CS "discoverers” 
        (students who only started studying CS in college). 
        I teach <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/#/">weekly tutoring sections</a> 
        for one of Berkeley’s CS major prerequisite courses, CS61b. I additionally run an 
        education program for new developers in <a href="https://calblueprint.org">Blueprint</a>, a Berkeley CS club for social good. 
        <br/> 
        <br/>
        When I step away from my computer, I'm usually out rock climbing in Yosemite or
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/38547225">cycling</a> the Bay
        Area. I’m presently on the lookout for SWE internships and computing
        research opportunities. My email and resume are above, please don't
        hesitate to reach out!

          <!-- TODO: add TCA video -->
          <br />
          During my gap year (2018), I worked as a film editor on Never Not Collective's 
           film, <em>Pretty Strong</em>. It was the first feature-length film to focus solely on 
          only female world-class rock climbers.
          <br />
          That year, I also produced my own short film, <em>A Moment With George Johanson</em>, featuring my 
          grandfather, an Oregon-renowned fine artist. It is one of my proudest art pieces to date.
